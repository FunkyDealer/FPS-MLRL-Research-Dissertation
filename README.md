Combining Curriculum Learning and Behaviour Cloning to train First-person Shooter Agents.

With this project, we hope to compare two of the Reinforcement Learning training methods applied to First Person Shooter games, Curriculum Learning and Behaviour Cloning, and combine them to evaluate whether they bring better performance when combined. To do this, we will train agents with each method and then with the combination of both, and after that make each agent battle each otherâ€™s to evaluate performance thought obtained victories.
